It started its operation as a Barrio High School in August 2, 1968 with its borrowed building. The school then had its lone teacher, Mr. David Tamayao under the supervision of Mr. Isaias Aguinaldo, the then Head Teacher of Nabannagan Elementary School.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="history-card">

            </div>
            <div class="history-card">
                <p>Mr. Napoleon A. Batulan, the principal of the newly established Western Cagayan Vocational High School, negotiated the purchase and acquisition of 12.5 hectares of land in addition to the 3.5 hectares donated by Mrs. Natalia A. Lim, Mr. Marcelo de los Santos and Mr. Guillermo Buenavista.</p>
            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="history-card">

            </div>
            <div class="history-card">
                <p>When Mr. Usita died, came Dir. Nestor C. Ave, the then Provincial Director of TESDA Isabela, as the Oversight Director of the school. He did not stay long in the school but short stay many projects were realized which included the concretion of the pavement in front of the administration building.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="history-card">
                <p>After a few months came another VSA in the person of Mr. Joselito S. Tolvo. During his term, the school was able to garner regional and national awards like <span>Gabay Nayon Award</span>, <span>Katangitanging Serbisyo Award</span>, <span>Lakan-Ilaw award</span>, <span>Model Employee Award (Regional level)</span> and <span>TESDA Idol Award (Regional Level)</span>. Additional tools and equipment for the different qualifications were also acquired from TESDA Central Office. Most of the trainers were reclassified / levelled up in their positions through NBC No. 461.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="history-card">
                <p>Due to the untimely death of Mr. Tolvo, Mr. Jimmy V. Lamug, took over as Officer-in-Charge and later became Vocational School Administrator.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="history-card">
                <p>Under the administration of Mr. Lamug, the Commercial Cooking laboratory was reconstructed to meet the laboratory area requirements for Cookery NC II. The Automotive Servicing NC I and NC II laboratories were improved with the purchase of additional equipment. Driving NC II levelled up with the purchase of a new car for driving instruction. Food & Beverage Services NC II lab was improved and Dressmaking NC II lab was enriched with 11 units of high speed sewing machines acquired from TESDA Central Office and another ten units of portable sewing machines. The school fa√ßade was also constructed and the most significant improvement was the development of the agricultural area with the construction of the green house. It was also Mr. Lamug who initiated the Mushroom Culture and Production project. He also made some tie ups with the local government of Lasam and nearby municipalities as partners in skills development.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="history-card">
                <p>The school then acquired agricultural equipment from LGU Lasam under the administration of Hon. Marjorie Apil-Salazar like shredder, Rice Planter and building for the Vermi culture and mushroom production. He also spearheaded the concreting of the school road network, repair of roofings of school buildings and the completion of the roof of the gymnasium. He had lots of plans and dreams for the school but because of his mandatory retirement, he had left the school with many unfinished plans.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="history-card">
                <p>When Mr. Lamug retired in November 2017, Mrs. Editha B. Mansion took over the responsibility to man the school as Acting VSA, She continued to serve and lead the faculty and staff to work for the goals and objectives of the school and to continued the implementation of the unfinished plans and projects of the previous administration.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="history-card">
                <p>Four months after, on May 3, 2018, Engr. Dominador D. Dizon assumed into office as the new Vocational School Administrator. With his administration, he shows a lot of encouragement and dedication to his work and to the employees. The determination of a leader to work hand in hand with his men to meet the challenges of managing the school is evident to his actions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="history-card">
